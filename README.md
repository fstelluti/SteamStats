# SteamStats using R
#### A C++ GUI application that analyses and displays gaming statistics from Steam using R and Rinside

Currently in the early stages.

Plan is to have a wide range of statistical analysis performed on Steam data, and to have these statistics displayed as graphs and numbers within in the application. Uses C++ and the statistical computing and graphics programming language R, which is embedded within C++ using Rinside, and QT creator to create the interface.
